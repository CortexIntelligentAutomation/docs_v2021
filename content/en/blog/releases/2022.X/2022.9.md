## Release Notes

### Overview

2022.9 is the first release of our next generation of Cortex and begins our journey to improve on the previous 7.X generation in the following areas:

- Cost of ownership
- Speed and ease of developing, deploying and maintaining automation solutions
- Security
- Performance
- Observability
- Availability
- Scalability
- Documentation

This first release shows [improved performance vs 7.X][Improved Performance vs 7.X], using a new [high availability (HA) architecture][] and [components][] including the new [Innovation Engine][] which has support for [180+ blocks][].

Speed and ease of developing automation solutions has been improved with the introduction of:

- A [new Property Editor][] for configuring blocks
- [Validation messages][] to warn the developer of errors with their flows
- [Flow contracts][] declaring what information is required to run a flow and what data will be returned.

A new [Package Management][] system has been introduced to improve the speed and ease of deploying solutions into production.

Security has been improved by the introduction of the new concept of [Encrypted Text][], which ensures sensitive information must be encrypted before a flow can be run.

[Structured Logging][] has been introduced and acts as the source of data for the new [Grafana Dashboards][] providing observability over the platform health and flow execution requests.

Finally, this [Product Portal][] has been created to act as a central source of information regarding the Innovation Platform, including information of how to [install Innovation on its own][] or [add it to an existing 7.X installation][].

### Features

#### Improved Performance vs 7.X

The 2022.9 release has shown significant performance improvements compared to 7.X both in our own observations and customers installations. For example, one customer solution that has been migrated to 2022.9 has shown the time taken to run their tests reduce from 210 minutes to 10 minutes.

#### New HA architecture

Innovation can be installed on-premise across multiple servers with our new [high availability (HA) architecture][Innovation Only - Multiple Server - With HA] based on Microsoft's [Service Fabric][TODO]. This provides:

- Elimination of single points of failure resulting in reduced downtime
- The ability to perform zero downtime upgrades
- Increased processing capacity resulting in increased throughput

It also lays the foundations for future releases to provide:

- Manual scaling and on demand automated scaling
- Single click deployments and upgrades
- Multi Tenancy, including the ability to choose the level of separation of tenants based on your compliance and hardware constraints

The use of Service Fabric currently permits deployment on VMs hosted with any [cloud service provider][TODO], and in future deploying on Microsoft's [Azure Service Fabric][TODO] and [Linux][TODO] based operating systems.

#### New Innovation Engine

TODO: Review

A new engine, which executes the automation solutions developed for the Innovation Platform, has been created. In early customer deployments this has shown a [dramatic improvement in performance vs the 7.X Engine][Improved Performance vs 7.X].

The new engine supports [expressions][] written in the [C# Programming Language][C# code].

It also lays the foundations for future releases to provide:

- [Autogeneration][TODO] of new blocks from existing dotnet [dlls][TODO] and [nuget packages][TODO]
- An [SDK][TODO] to develop your own blocks
- Execution of automation solutions on [Linux][TODO] based operating systems
- Execution of automation solutions on serverless cloud services such as Microsoft's [Azure Functions][TODO] and [AWS Lamdba][]

#### Innovation Engine Requires New Cortex.lic Licence

A new Cortex.lic licence is required in order to [debug][] flows developed for the Innovation Engine and [execute][] them in Production.

For more information about licensing requirements, including how to obtain a licence, see:

Installing Innovation Only:

- [Single Server - Without HA][Innovation Only - Single Server - Without HA]
- [Multiple Server - With HA][Innovation Only - Multiple Server - With HA]

Adding Innovation to a 7.2 Installation:

- [Single Server - Without HA][Adding Innovation to a 7.2 Installation - Single Server - Without HA]
- [Multiple Server - With HA][Adding Innovation to a 7.2 Installation - Multiple Server - With HA]

Please note 7.2 installations still require a g2.ok licence for each Cortex Server component.

Affected Components:

- Flow Debugger Service
- Flow Execution Service

#### 180+ New Blocks

180+ new [Blocks][] have been added to the Innovation platform to work with:

- [Data][]
- [Date & Time][]
- [Decisions][]
- [Dictionaries][]
- [Email][]
- [Exceptions][]
- [Files & Folders][]
- [Flows][]
- [Google Workspace][]
- [Http][]
- [Lists][]
- [Logs][]
- [Microsoft365][]
- [Objects][]
- [PowerShell][]
- [Schedules][]
- [Ssh][]
- [Text][]
- [Variables][]
- [Workspaces][]
- [Xml][]

Many palettes include blocks for performing single and batch operations, such as [copying a single file][Copy File] or [copying multiple files][Copy Files].

In comparison to 7.X, improvements have been made to:

- The performance of blocks in the Innovation platform
- The consistency in naming of blocks and properties in relation to their functionality
- The consistency in functionality across similar palettes such as [Lists][] and [Dictionaries][]

Most blocks have a [Block Timeout][] property that can be used to cancel a block operation if it has run for longer than intended.

Affected Components:

- Blocks

#### New concept of Encryptable and Encrypted Text

The concept of Encryptable and Encrypted text has been added to the Innovation Engine, allowing for data to be encrypted and handled by the platform.

Two [data types][Concept: Data Types] have been added, [EncryptableText][] and [EncryptedText][]. Any block property using [EncryptableText][] allows for encrypted, partially encrypted or unencrypted values to be used. Any block property using [EncryptedText][] will only allow encrypted values to be used, throwing an error if partially encrypted or unencrypted values are used.

The same encryption mechanism is used in both the 2022.9 and the 7.X platforms.

Affected Components:

- Blocks
- Gateway

#### New Property Editor

A new [Property Editor][] has been added to [Cortex Studio][] for configuring [blocks][block], allowing for quicker configuration and better ease of use compared to 7.X.

Each [Block Property][] can be configured using one of three new editors:

- [Variable Editor][New Property Editor: Variable Editor]
- [Literal Editor][New Property Editor: Literal Editor]
- [Expression Editor][New Property Editor: Expression Editor]

##### Variable Editor

The [Variable Editor][Guide: Variable Editor] is used to select, create and rename [variables][fundamentals: variables] that will be used by a [block][]. It has [typeahead][] selection of variables accessible by the block being configured, highlighting if the variable selected is missing and not available.

The Variable Editor allows for the creation of missing variables at the [scope][] of the block being configured.

The Variable Editor allows for a variable to be renamed from within the editor, also updating any references to this variable in the [flow][].

##### Literal Editor

The [Literal Editor][Guide: Literal Editor] is used to create [complex data types][] more easily, allowing you to switch between any available [Data Types][] for the [Block Property][] selected.

Please note that the Literal Editor does not currently support any [Collection][] data types, this may change in a future release.

##### Expression Editor

The [Expression Editor][Guide: Expression Editor] allows for use of [C# code][] for the [Block Property][] selected. It contains built in encryption to convert any text highlighted to an [EncryptedText][].

It also has:

- Built-in [snippets][] that are filtered based on the [Block Property][] selected to help configure the block
- Built-in [tools][], such as Full Screen, Find and Replace, Change all occurrences, etc

##### Other Features of the Property Editor

Other features of the [Property Editor][] include:

- Creating all missing [variables][fundamentals: variables] required by a [block][] using the [Add Variables button][]
- Every [block][] has a sensible editor selected for each [Block Property][], as well as a sensible default value to minimise the configuration required
- [Advanced Properties][] that do not normally need to be configured have preset default values and are hidden from view
- [Advanced Properties][] can be shown for more complex configuration of blocks using the [Show/Hide Advanced Properties button][]
- The Product Portal page for a block can be accessed from the [Property Editor][] by using the [Help button][]

Affected Components:

- Flow Debugging Service
- Gateway

#### Messages

Validation is now performed before a [flow execution][] begins, the process will evaluate the [flow][] assessing for any issues that would cause the flow to fail and returns them as [validation errors][].

After [validating a flow][] in development, any [validation][] message in the [messages grid][] can be double clicked to navigate to the source of the issue.

TODO: Foundations for configurable best practices - different levels of validation and control over which errors and warnings are enforced
  - Is a rule an error or warning or do nothing
- Leads to auto fixes on specific errors and warnings

Affected Components:

- Flow Debugging Service
- Gateway

#### Flow Contract

[Flows][flow] can now declare which [Input Variables][] are required to run the flow, and what [Output Variables][] will be returned by the flow. This is called the Flow Contract.

If a call to start a flow [execution][flow execution] does not meet the requirements of the Flow Contract, then the execution will not begin and [validation errors][] will be returned.

#### Calling other Flows

[Flows][flow] can be called from within another flow by using the [Run Flow][] block, passing in any [Input Variables][] required by the child flow, and returning any [Output Variables][] when the child flow's [execution][flow execution] has completed.

By default a new flow is set up to [handle any exceptions at the flow level][] and end the flow without error. However, when calling a child flow it may be useful to propagate any [exceptions][what is an exception] to the parent flow; this can be done by using the [Rethrow Exception][] block within the [Handle Flow Exception][] workspace, causing the flow to end with an error.

Please note:

- Flows can only be run synchronously and the parent flow will wait for any child flow execution to finish before continuing. This may change in a future release to support running flows asynchronously
- In 7.X, flows could also call subtasks. In 2022.9 and onwards, subtasks no longer exist

#### Debug with Input Variables

When [debugging][debug] a [flow][], any [Input Variables][] can be provided within the [Input Variables property][] in the flow's [Settings Editor][].

Affected Components:

- Flow Debugging Service
- Gateway

#### Package Management

TODO:

A new [Package Management][TODO] system has been added to [Gateway][] and can be accessed through [Cortex Studio][]. It improves the speed and ease of deploying solutions into production by allowing a [flow developer][flow developers] to:

- Create a package version
- Publish a package version (When a package is first published a default package version will be set implicitly)
- Explicitly set your own default package version, this allows for a production version of the package to be used by default
- Unpublish a package version that is no longer required on a system
- Import/Export a package version into Gateway

[Flows][flow] within a package can be [executed][execute] through [Gateway][]:

- Making a request without specifying a package will cause the flow within the default package will be executed
- Making a request and specifying a package will cause the flow within the specified package will be executed

It is also possible to execute a flow within a specific version of a package:

- Making a request without specifying a package version will cause the flow referenced in the default package version of the selected package to be executed
- Making a request and specifying a package version will cause the flow referenced in the specific version of the package to be executed



- Create a package version
- Publish a package version (When a package is first published a default package version will be set implicitly)
- Explicitly set your own default package version, this allows for a production version of the package to be used by default
- Unpublish a package version that is no longer required on a system
- Import/Export a package version into Gateway
- Flow Execution
  - Default Package / Default Package Version
  - Specific Package / Specific Package Version
  - Specific Package / Default Package Version
  - Default Package / Specific Package Version

- Side by Side execution - Lays foundation for future multi tenancy and CI/CD Pipelines
- Environment Variables based on system and tenancy levels

#### Structured Logging

Structured logging provides a defined format for [logs][reference: logs] produced by the Innovation Platform, this helps with reporting and diagnostics and is used as the source of [dashboards][Grafana Dashboards]. The structured logs produced are in a [JSON][] format.

Structured logging has been added to the following components:

- [API Gateway][Logs: API Gateway]
- [Flow Debugger Service][Logs: Flow Debugger Service]

The ability to write structured logs has also been exposed to [flow developers][] so they can write logs in the same format as the platform; they can be created by using the [Log Event][] block.

Please note that structured logging may be added to more components in a future release.

TODO:

Leads to:
- alerting
- request tracing (opentelemetry)

#### Grafana Dashboards

[Dashboards][] have been created to provide observability of the Innovation Platform in Production.

The new dashboards are:

- [Platform Health][]
- [Flow Execution Requests][]

In future additional dashboards may be added. Currently, these have been produced for Grafana and in future releases other reporting and observability platforms such as Splunk and Elastic may be supported.

For more information about adding observability to Innovation see:

- [Installing Grafana On-Premise][]
- [Setup Grafana Cloud][]

### Simplified Installation

TODO:

Compared to 7.X, installing 2022.9 has been simplified in the following ways:

- Scripts a

In future will look at combining with multi tenancy and single click installation

### API First and API Versioning

TODO

#### Product Portal

The Product Portal contains materials regarding the 2022.9 release and how to use the product; it is hosted online but can be hosted locally if required.

[Cortex Studio][] integrates with the portal, providing links to documentation for Blocks and Exceptions. In future this may extend to Validation Messages, Guides, Tutorials, etc.

[Cortex Studio][] can be configured to connect and integrate with a locally hosted version of the Product Portal; typically this would only be required for air gapped systems where connectivity to the internet is unavailable.

Affected Components:

- Blocks
- Gateway

### Bug Fixes

As 2022.9 is the first GA release of the platform there are no bug fixes.

### Deprecated Features

The following features have been deprecated in the 2022.9 release:

- SQL Server will no longer be required by Gateway in a future release; currently targeting removal in the 2023.3 or 2023.6 release and no additional third party software should be required

### Removed Features

The following features have been removed in the 2022.9 release:
